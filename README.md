# mmbruteluck
Replication files for "Choice and personal responsibility" by Alexander W. Cappelen, 
Sebastian Fest, Erik Ø. Sørensen, and Bertil Tungodden.

The code can be inspected at the github site, but it can also be installed
as an R package, in which case the analysis of the paper is installed as vignettes,
and the data are available when the package is installed. 

Installing the package requires:
```
library(devtools)
install_github("fair-nhh/mmbruteluck")
```
