# Reading data and creating summaries
```{r}
rdf_summary <- mturk_workers %>% group_by(treatment) %>%
  summarize(mean_age = mean(age), se_age = sd(age)/sqrt(n()),
            mean_female = mean(female), se_female= sd(female)/sqrt(n()),
            mean_education = mean(education), se_education = sd(education)/sqrt(n()),
            mean_political = mean(political), se_political = sd(political)/sqrt(n()),
            n = n())

rdf_totals <- mturk_workers %>% 
    summarize(mean_age = mean(age), se_age = sd(age)/sqrt(n()),
            mean_female = mean(female), se_female= sd(female)/sqrt(n()),
            mean_education = mean(education), se_education = sd(education)/sqrt(n()),
            mean_political = mean(political), se_political = sd(political)/sqrt(n()),
            n = n())
```

## Output of balance table (with marginals)
```{r}
rdf_summary %>% knitr::kable(digits=c(3,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0))
rdf_totals %>% knitr::kable(digits=c(1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,0))
```

Requested balance tests:
```{r}
mturk_workers %>% lm(age ~ treatment, data=.) %>% summary()
mturk_workers %>% lm(female ~ treatment, data=.) %>% summary()
mturk_workers %>% lm(education ~ treatment, data=.) %>% summary()
mturk_workers %>% lm(political ~ treatment, data=.) %>% summary()

```




How many non-safe-choice workers?
```{r}
table(mturk_workers$safe)
```


# What did the spectators do?
```{r}
mturk_workers %>% group_by(treatment) %>%
  summarize(mean_safe = mean(safe))
```

# sessionInfo()
```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
