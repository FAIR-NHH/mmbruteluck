<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>
Welcome to this research project! We very much appreciate your participation.<br>
This is a study about the economics of decision-making. Several research institutions have provided funds for this research.<br><strong>Payment</strong><br>
Your payment will consist of the participation fee plus the amount of bonus points that you accumulate throughout the study. Your initial endowment of bonus points amounts to 50 bonus points. The exact amount of bonus points that you receive will depend on your and/or others’ decision. At the end, each bonus points is converted into USD at a rate of 1 cent per bonus point.<br>
Your bonus will be paid to you using the bonus system within a few weeks after the completion of this HIT. Your payment for taking the HIT will be sent to you shortly after the completion of this HIT.<br><strong>Procedures</strong><br>
The study consists of two parts and you will be given instructions on your screen before every single part of the survey. Please always make sure to read the instructions carefully before you continue.<br><strong>Participation</strong><br>
Participation in this research study is completely voluntary. You have the right to withdraw at anytime or refuse to participate entirely without jeopardy to future participation in other studies conducted by us.<br><strong>Confidentiality</strong></p>
<p>All data obtained from you will be kept confidential and will only be reported in an aggregate format (by reporting only combined results and never reporting individual ones). All submissions will be concealed, and no one other than the primary investigator will have access to them. The data collected will be stored in the HIPPA-compliant, secure database until it has been deleted by us.<br><strong>Verification</strong><br>
At the end of this survey, you will be given a completion code. You will need to copy this code to the survey code field on the AMT web page that directed you here at the beginning.<br><strong>Questions about the Research</strong><br>
If you have questions regarding this study, you may contact:<br>

<blockquote>
<p>[The following text applies only to subjects who had to fulfill the work requirement]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the first part of this study, we ask you to work on an assignment. After you are done with the assignments, a number of bonus points will be determined for you.<br>
The first part of this study is followed by a redistribution phase and a set of general questions that will complete this study.<br>
Please always make sure to read the instructions carefully before you continue.<br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Description of the picture categorization task]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the assignment, you will be working on a picture categorization task. You will see a picture on your screen and are asked to select the categories from the menu below the picture that you think fit to the picture and its content. You can select multiple categories from the menu if you think that the picture fits into that category as well.<br>
Your answer will be submitted automatically after 30 seconds and you will be given a new picture. The task will last for 10 minutes and we ask you to work thoroughly with each picture.<br></p>

<blockquote>
<p>[The following text applies only to subjects in the Baseline treatment with and without work requirement]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your bonus points will be determined by a lottery in which you with equal probability can earn 800 bonus points or 0 bonus points. In the lottery, a ball will be randomly drawn from an urn containing an equal number of yellow and green balls. If a yellow ball is drawn, you will earn 800 bonus points, and if a green ball is drawn, you will earn 0 bonus points.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[The following text applies only to subjects in the Forced Choice treatment with and without work requirement]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your bonus points will be determined in the following way. You can either choose to earn 25 bonus points or to let the amount of bonus points be determined by a lottery in which you with equal probability can earn 800 bonus points or 0 bonus points. In the lottery, a ball will be randomly drawn from an urn containing an equal number of yellow and green balls. If a yellow ball is drawn, you will earn 800 bonus points, and if a green ball is drawn, you will earn 0 bonus points.<br></p>

<p>Your bonus points will be determined in the following way. You can either choose to earn no bonus points or to let the amount of bonus points be determined by a lottery in which you with equal probability can earn 800 bonus points or 0 bonus points. In the lottery, a ball will be randomly drawn from an urn containing an equal number of yellow and green balls. If a yellow ball is drawn, you will earn 800 bonus points, and if a green ball is drawn, you will earn 0 bonus points.<br></p>

<p>Your bonus points will be determined in the following way. You can either choose to get 25 bonus points deducted from the amount of bonus points that you currently have or to let the amount of bonus points be determined by a lottery in which you with equal probability can earn 800 bonus points or 0 bonus points. In the lottery, a ball will be randomly drawn from an urn containing an equal number of yellow and green balls. If a yellow ball is drawn, you will earn 800 bonus points, and if a green ball is drawn, you will earn 0 bonus points.<br></p>

<p>Your bonus points will be determined in the following way. You can choose between two colors, yellow and green. Your choice of color will then determine the outcome of a lottery in which you with equal probability can earn 800 bonus points or 0 bonus points. In the lottery, a ball will be randomly drawn from an urn containing an equal number of yellow and green balls. If you chose the color of the ball that is drawn, you will earn 800 bonus points, if you choose the other color, you will earn 0 bonus points.<br></p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>[The following text applies to all treatments involving a work requirement and subjects who faced a lottery draw to determine earnings]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We will now explain how the final amount of bonus points is generated.<br>
The total amount of bonus points you receive consists of the initial endowment plus what you earned for working on the assignment.<br><strong>Initial Endowment</strong><br>
The initial endowment was 50 bonus points.<br><strong>Assignment</strong><br>
For determining the earnings from the assignments, we will match you with another participant who has completed the same HIT. The payment to you and the other participant is then determined in the following way.<br>
First, the outcome of the payment lotteries will be determined. Afterwards, a randomly selected third person who has not participated in this study will be given the opportunity to redistribute the earnings from the assignment between you and the other participant. This person will not know the identity of you or the other participant, but will be informed about the nature of the assignment and your earnings for this assignment.<br>
If the third person chooses not to redistribute, each of you will be paid your earnings from the assignment. If the third person chooses to redistribute earnings, then each of you will be paid according to this decision.<br></p>

<p>We now ask you to make a choice that can have consequences for a real life situation. We will randomly select one out of five respondents and implement the choice made by this respondent.</p>
<p>A few days ago, individuals were recruited via an online labor market to participate in a study. They were paid a participation compensation of 2 USD, but could also earn additional money in the course of the study.</p>
<p>In the study, participants were asked to work on an assignment. Participants were not told how they will be paid for the assignment before the assignment was completed. After the assignment was completed, participants were informed that their earnings would be determined by a lottery.</p>
<p>In the lottery, a ball would be randomly drawn from an urn containing an equal number of yellow and green balls. If a yellow ball was drawn, the participant would earn 8 USD, and if a green ball was drawn the participant would earn 0 USD for completing the assignment.</p>
<p>Participants were not informed about the outcome of the lottery. However, they were told that they would be matched with another participant who had also taken part in the study. They were also told that a third-party person not taking part in the study would be informed about the assignment and their earnings. This third-party person would be given the opportunity to redistribute the earnings between the two of them and thus determine how much each of them was paid for the assignment.</p>
<p>We now want you to choose whether to redistribute the earnings between two of the participants – who we are going to refer to as participant A and participant B. Your decision is completely anonymous. The participants will receive the payment that you choose for them within a few days, but will not receive any further information.</p>
<p>A yellow ball was drawn for participant A while a green ball was drawn for participant B. Therefore, participant A earned 8 USD while participant B earned 0 USD.</p>
<p>In the field below, we ask you to write how much of the 8 USD you want to transfer from participant A to participant B. Remember that your choice will determine how much participant A and participant B are paid for the assignment.</p>

<p>We now ask you to make a choice that can have consequences for a real life situation. We will randomly select one out of five respondents and implement the choice made by this respondent.</p>
<p>A few days ago, individuals were recruited via an online labor market to participate in a study. They were paid a participation compensation of 2 USD, but could also earn additional money in the course of the study.</p>
<p>Participants could choose to let their earnings be determined by a lottery or not. In the lottery, a ball would be randomly drawn from an urn containing an equal number of yellow and green balls. If a yellow ball was drawn, the participant would earn 8 USD, and if a green ball was drawn the participant would earn 0 USD. If they did not choose the lottery, they would earn 0 USD in addition.</p>
<p>Participants who chose the lottery to determine earnings were not informed about the outcome of the lottery. However, they were told that they would be matched with another participant who had also taken part in the study. They were also told that a third-party person not taking part in the study would be informed about their earnings. This third-party person would be given the opportunity to redistribute the earnings between the two of them and thus determine how much each of them was paid.</p>
<p>We now want you to choose whether to redistribute the earnings between two of the participants – who we are going to refer to as participant A and participant B. Your decision is completely anonymous. The participants will receive the payment that you choose for them within a few days, but will not receive any further information.</p>
<p>Both participants chose the lottery to determine earnings. A yellow ball was drawn for participant A while a green ball was drawn for participant B. Therefore, participant A earned 8 USD while participant B earned 0 USD.</p>
<p>In the field below, we ask you to write how much of the 8 USD you want to transfer from participant A to participant B. Remember that your choice will determine how much participant A and participant B are paid.</p>

<p>A few days ago, individuals were recruited via an online labor market to participate in a study. They were paid a participation compensation of 2 USD, but could also earn additional money in the course of the study.</p>
<p>In the study, participants were asked to work on an assignment. Participants were not told how they will be paid for the assignment before the assignment was completed. After the assignment was completed, participants were informed that they could choose how their earnings for the assignment would be determined.</p>
<p>Participants could choose between two colors, yellow and green, where their choice would determine the outcome of a lottery. In the lottery, a ball would be randomly drawn from an urn containing an equal number of yellow and green balls. If they chose the color of the ball that was drawn, they would earn 8 USD, if they chose the other color, they would earn 0 USD for completing the assignment.</p>
<p>Participants were not informed about the outcome of the lottery. However, they were told that they would be matched with another participant who had also taken part in the study.

<p>Welcome to this experiment. My name is ... and I will lead this session.<br>
In this experiment you can, depending on the decisions you and others make and independent of your seating in one of the rooms, earn more money in addition to the 100 NOK that you receive in show-up fee. Your earnings will be added to your show-up fee and paid to you in cash at the end of the session.<br>
The results of this experiment are going to be used in a research project and it is therefore important that everybody complies with the guidelines that are also lying on your desks.<br></p>
<ul>
<li>You are not allowed to talk to other participants during the session.</li>
<li>If you have questions, please raise your hand. A member of the research team will come to you and answer them in private.</li>
<li>You must not open other webpages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Violation of these rules will lead to the exclusion from the session and all payments. It is likely that there will be small delays during this session and we ask you to remain seated and quiet.<br>
You will be completely anonymous throughout the session, which means that it will not be possible for the other participants - or us - to identify which decisions you have made.<br>
At the end of the session you will get a payment code on your screen. You will be asked to write this code down on the sheet that is in the folder next to you. You will show this sheet when you leave the session, and you will then be handed over an envelope with the corresponding code, which contains the money you have earned in the session. The research assistants who have prepared the envelope will not be in the room when the envelopes are distributed, which ensures that no one can identify how much each of you have earned in the session.<br>
The experiment consists of three parts and you will be given instructions on your screen before every single part of the experiment. We will soon reveal information about the first part of the experiment on your pc-screen. Please make sure to read the instructions carefully before you confirm that you have read the instructions.<br></p>

<p>In the first part of the experiment you will be working on a language task. You will be shown five English words and are asked to form a sentence or an expression by using four of these words. The sentence or expression must contain four words. For example, if the words given to you are “sky, blue, is, the, old”, then you can construct the sentence “the sky is blue”.<br>
We ask you to work continuously with this task for 30 minutes. After you have submitted a sentence or expression, you will be given five new words. The aim of this task is not to submit as many sentences or expressions as possible but to work thoroughly with each set of words. Please work continuously on this task until the given time has run out.</p>

We ask you to write down your own personal payment code on the sheet that is provided to you for this purpose on your desk. Make sure to write down the code correctly since this will identify your payment from the experiment.</p>
<p>As soon as the envelopes with payment have been brought into the lab, we will start the payment process. On request, show the payment code to my colleague and he will hand you the envelope with this code. This envelop contains your earnings. Please remain seated until we read your payment code.</p>
